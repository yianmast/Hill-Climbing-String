Title:     Hill Climbing: String Matcher
Author:    Ioannis Mastoras
Created:   16 March 2020
Updated:   24 May 2025

Description:
    A simple implementation of the Hill Climbing algorithm to evolve a random 
    string into a target string using mutation and score evaluation. It 
    demonstrates the basics of optimization through iterative improvement.

Functions:
    - rs(target_str): Generates a random solution of the same length as the target string.
    - score(solution): Evaluates how close a solution is to the target (lower is better).
    - mutate(solution): Randomly changes one character in the solution.
    - main(): Runs the hill climbing process and reports progress.

Dependencies:
    - Python standard library: random, string

Usage:
    Run the script and input a target string when prompted. The algorithm will
    attempt to match the string using simple hill climbing.
